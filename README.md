# practicing-express-js

## Getting Started

- Ensure you have node installed
- Create a package.json using `npm init -y` and `server.js` file
- Install express library: `npm i express`
- Install nodemon: `npm i --save-dev nodemon`
- Add `"watch": "nodemon server.js"` to `"scripts"` in package.json. Now you can use the command `npm run watch` to view your updates to code in real time. You can name "watch" whatever you want.
